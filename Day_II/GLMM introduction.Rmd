knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### Example dataset: trees

• Data on 1000 trees from 10 sites. • Trees per site: 4 - 392.

```{r}
library(curl)
trees <- read.csv(curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orrortega/statistics-natural-resources/main/Day_II/Data/trees.csv")) 
head(trees)
```

```{r}
trees$site <- as.factor(trees$site)
```

### Q: What's the relationship between tree diameter and height?

#### A simple linear model

```{r}
lm.simple <- lm(height ~ dbh, data = trees) 
summary(lm.simple)
```

#### Single intercept

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
ggplot(trees) +
aes(dbh, height) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 3) +
labs(x = "DBH (cm)", y = "Height (m)", title = "Single intercept") + theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

#### What if allometry varies among sites?

```{r}
ggplot(subset(trees, site == 1 | site == 2)) + 
  aes(dbh, height, colour = site) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 3) + 
  labs(x = "DBH (cm)", y = "Height (m)",
  title = "Different intercept for each site") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Fitting a varying intercepts model with lm

```{r}
lm.interc <- lm(height ~ factor(site) + dbh, data = trees) 
summary(lm.interc)
```

#### Single vs varying intercept

```{r}
ggplot(trees) +
  aes(dbh, height) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 3) +
  labs(x = "DBH (cm)", y = "Height (m)", title = "Single intercept") + theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

```{r}
ggplot(trees) +
  aes(dbh, height, colour = site) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1.5, se = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "DBH (cm)", y = "Height (m)", title = "Different intercept for each site") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Mixed models enable us to account for variability

• Varying intercepts

• Varying slopes

**Mixed models estimate varying parameters (intercepts and/or slopes) with pooling among levels (rather than considering them fully independent)**

Hence there's gradient between

• complete pooling: Single overall intercept.

-- lm (height \~ dbh)

• no pooling: One independent intercept for each site.

-- lm (height \~ dbh + site)

• partial pooling: Inter-related intercepts.

-- lmer(height \~ dbh + (1 \| site))

**Random vs Fixed effects?**

1.  Fixed effects constant across individuals, random effects vary.

2.  Effects are fixed if they are interesting in themselves; random if interest in the underlying population.

3.  Fixed when sample exhausts the population; random when the sample is small part of the population.

4.  Random effect if it's assumed to be a realized value of random variable.

5.  Fixed effects estimated using least squares or maximum likelihood; random effects estimated with shrinkage.

**What is a random effect, really?**

• Varies by group

• Variation estimated with probability model

Random effects are estimated with *partial pooling*, while fixed effects are not (infinite variance).

**Shrinkage improves parameter estimation**

Especially for groups with low sample size

#### Fitting mixed/multilevel models

```{r}
library(lme4)
mixed <- lmer(height ~ dbh + (1|site), data = trees) 
summary(mixed)
```

#### Retrieve model coefficients

```{r}
coef(mixed)
```

#### Visualising model: allEffects

```{r}
library(effects)
allEffects(mixed)
```

```{r}
plot(allEffects(mixed))
```

#### Visualising model: visreg

```{r}
library(visreg)
visreg(mixed, xvar = "dbh", by = "site", overlay = FALSE)
```

#### Visualising model: sjPlot

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
library(sjPlot)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16)) 
#sjp.lmer(mixed, type = "ri.slope") 
#plot_model(mixed, type = "eff")
sjPlot::plot_model(mixed, type = "re")
```

#### Checking residuals

```{r}
plot(mixed)
```

Checking residuals

```{r}
ggResidpanel::resid_panel(mixed)
```

#### Checking residuals (DHARMa)

```{r}
DHARMa::simulateResiduals(mixed, plot = TRUE, use.u = TRUE)
```
